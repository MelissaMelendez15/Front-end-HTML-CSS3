# Frontend-HTML-CSS3-Interactive

Frontend Pilot Designs

I have created as a practice a frontend prototype using Interactive HTML5 AND CSS3 to later implement it with JavaScript and React.js

## Installation

Code Studio Visual as a code editor. Just click with the right button on the HTML document and choose the option "Open with default Browser", and it will automatically open the Web in your browser.

## Contributing
Pull requests and new ideas are welcome.
Be sure to update the tests accordingly.
